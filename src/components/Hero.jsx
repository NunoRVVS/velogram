        <h3>The training Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>This training program is made of <b>2-phases</b> as follows ⬇️</p>
            <h6>Phase 1</h6>
            <p>Getting started in part 1 of Base Phase is simple: All rides should be done in zone 2 for four to eight weeks. Ideally, you’re able to train four to six hours per week. Remember, though, if you’re not riding a ton yet, build up to this much time in the saddle.</p>
            <h6>Phase 2</h6>
            <p>In the second part of your base training, you’ll add a bit of intensity, while still staying in the aerobic zones. For four to eight weeks, your goal is to do two slightly harder short rides, plus one long zone 2 ride. Ideally, you’re able to train four to six hours per week.</p>
        </ul>
